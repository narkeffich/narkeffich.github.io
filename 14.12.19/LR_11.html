		<div id='kira'>My name is Yoshikage Kira.</div>
		<ul>
		<li>I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married.</li>
		<li>I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest.</li>
		<li>I don't smoke, but I ocassionaly drink.</li>
		<li>I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what.</li>
		<li>After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.</li>
		<li>Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.</li>
		<li>I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.</li>
		<li>I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.</li>
		<li>I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.</li>
		</ul>
		That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.
		<div id='ahem'>Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.</div>
